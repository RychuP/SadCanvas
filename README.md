# Description
Canvas is a fairly simple class deriving from 
[ScreenObject](https://github.com/Thraka/SadConsole/blob/master/SadConsole/ScreenObject.cs) 
that allows direct manipulation of texture pixels used to render it to the screen.
It offers basic texture management, pixel and primitive shape drawing tools. Compatible with SadConsole v9. There is only a handful of methods fairly self explanatory hence no separate documentation. Check out the [Test](https://github.com/RychuP/SadCanvas/tree/master/Test) project to see what the library can do.
Version 10 of SadConsole offers a new [class](https://sadconsole.com/api/SadConsole.Components.DrawImage.html) to display images. Use that instead.
