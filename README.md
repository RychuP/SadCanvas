# SadCanvas v0.1.164
Canvas is a fairly simple class deriving from 
[ScreenObject](https://github.com/Thraka/SadConsole/blob/master/SadConsole/ScreenObject.cs) 
that allows direct manipulation of texture pixels used to render it to the screen. 
It offers basic texture management and pixel drawing tools. See the [Test](https://github.com/RychuP/SadCanvas/tree/master/Test)
project for examples of what the class can do.

Available to download as [Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SadCanvas).
