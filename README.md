# Description
Canvas is a fairly simple class deriving from 
[ScreenObject](https://github.com/Thraka/SadConsole/blob/master/SadConsole/ScreenObject.cs) 
that allows direct manipulation of texture pixels used to render it to the screen. 
It offers basic texture management and pixel drawing tools. Works with SadConsole v9.
