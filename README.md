# Description
Canvas is a fairly simple class deriving from 
[ScreenObject](https://github.com/Thraka/SadConsole/blob/master/SadConsole/ScreenObject.cs) 
that allows direct manipulation of texture pixels used to render it to the screen. 
It offers basic texture management, pixel and primitive shape drawing tools. Compatible with SadConsole v9. Check out the [Test](https://github.com/RychuP/SadCanvas/tree/master/Test) project to see what it can do. Work in progress most likely with many braking changes to come... Available to download as a [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SadCanvas).
